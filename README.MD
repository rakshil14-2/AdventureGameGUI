# II-A. How To Run in Eclipse:
-------------------
* OpenJavaFX and software is needed to run the program in Eclipse. Follow the guide here:
	* https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/#IDE-Eclipse
	
* To get Java 12 support, install the patch from the Eclipse MarketPlace: Java 12 Support for Eclipse 2019-03 (4.11).

* Download an appropriate JDK (version 8 or above) for your operating system and set JAVA_HOME to the JDK directory.

* Include the new JDK as Installed JREs in Eclipse -> Preferences -> Java -> Installed JREs -> Add.
		
* Download the appropriate JavaFX SDK for your operating system and unzip it to a desired location, for instance /Users/your-user/Downloads/javafx-sdk-14. Download JavaFX here: https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/
	
* Create a new User Library under Eclipse -> Window -> Preferences -> Java -> Build Path -> User Libraries -> New.
	
* Name it JavaFX14 and include the jars under the lib folder from JavaFX 14.
	
* Add VM Argument in Eclipse. Click on Run -> Run Configurations...  -> Java Application, create a new launch configuration for the project and add these VM arguments:
	* Linux/Mac:
		* --module-path /path/to/javafx-sdk-14/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml
	* Windows:
		* --module-path "\path\to\javafx-sdk-14\lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml
	
Now you can run the project from Eclipse.
	
# II-B. How To Compile:
-------------------
* OpenJavaFX software is needed to run the program. Install here:
	* https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/#install-java
	
* Add an environment variable pointing to the lib directory of the runtime using the terminal or the command prompt:
	* Linux/Mac:
		* export PATH_TO_FX=path/to/javafx-sdk-14/lib
	* Windows:
		* set PATH_TO_FX="path\to\javafx-sdk-14\lib"

You can now compile and run JavaFX applications from the command line using the JavaFX runtime.
